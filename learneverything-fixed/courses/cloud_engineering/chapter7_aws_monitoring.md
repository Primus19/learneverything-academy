- Ensure governance and compliance

Let's explore these services in detail and learn how to use them effectively.

## Amazon CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources. It collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.

### Key Features

- **Metrics**: Collect and track metrics for AWS resources and custom applications.
- **Logs**: Collect, monitor, analyze, and store log files.
- **Events**: Respond to state changes in AWS resources.
- **Alarms**: Create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or take actions.
- **Dashboards**: Create customizable dashboards to visualize metrics and alarms.
- **Anomaly detection**: Automatically detect anomalies in metrics.
- **ServiceLens**: Trace applications and visualize service maps.
- **Synthetics**: Create canaries to monitor endpoints and APIs.
- **Container Insights**: Collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from containerized applications.
- **Lambda Insights**: Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Lambda functions.

### CloudWatch Metrics

CloudWatch metrics are data about the performance of your systems. By default, many AWS services provide free metrics for resources (such as EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and RDS DB instances). You can also publish your own custom metrics.

Key concepts:
- **Namespace**: A container for metrics (e.g., AWS/EC2, AWS/RDS).
- **Metric**: A time-ordered set of data points (e.g., CPUUtilization, NetworkIn).
- **Dimension**: A name/value pair that uniquely identifies a metric (e.g., InstanceId=i-1234567890abcdef0).
- **Statistic**: A metric calculation over a specified period (e.g., Average, Sum, Minimum, Maximum).
- **Period**: The length of time associated with a specific statistic (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour).
- **Alarm**: Watches a metric and takes action when the metric crosses a threshold.

### CloudWatch Logs

CloudWatch Logs helps you centralize logs from all your systems, applications, and AWS services. You can monitor logs, store them securely, and access them for analysis.

Key concepts:
- **Log group**: A group of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings.
- **Log stream**: A sequence of log events from the same source.
- **Log event**: A record of activity recorded by the application or resource being monitored.
- **Metric filter**: A filter that extracts metric observations from ingested log events and transforms them into CloudWatch metrics.
- **Subscription filter**: A filter that sends log data to other AWS services for processing, analysis, or loading to other systems.

### Hands-on Lab: Working with CloudWatch Logs
