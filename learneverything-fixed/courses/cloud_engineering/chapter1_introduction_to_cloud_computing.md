# Chapter 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS

## Understanding Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations build and manage their IT infrastructure. Instead of maintaining physical servers and data centers, businesses can now leverage computing resources provided by cloud service providers on a pay-as-you-go basis. This shift from capital expenditure (CapEx) to operational expenditure (OpEx) has enabled businesses of all sizes to access enterprise-grade technology without significant upfront investments.

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

### Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

According to NIST, cloud computing has five essential characteristics:

1. **On-demand self-service**: Users can provision computing capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with service providers.

2. **Broad network access**: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous client platforms.

3. **Resource pooling**: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.

4. **Rapid elasticity**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.

5. **Measured service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.

### Cloud Service Models

Cloud computing services are typically offered in three main service models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS gives users access to computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking. Examples include Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. Examples include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Services.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Examples include Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.

In recent years, additional service models have emerged:

4. **Function as a Service (FaaS)**: A type of serverless computing that allows developers to execute code in response to events without managing the underlying infrastructure. Examples include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions.

5. **Container as a Service (CaaS)**: Provides container orchestration as a service. Examples include Amazon ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Azure Container Instances.

### Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud services can be deployed in different ways, depending on the organization's needs:

1. **Public Cloud**: Cloud services are provided by third-party providers and delivered over the internet. Resources are shared among multiple organizations. Examples include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

2. **Private Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure is operated solely for a single organization. It can be managed internally or by a third party and can be hosted on-premises or off-premises.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.

4. **Multi-Cloud**: The use of multiple cloud computing services from different providers in a single heterogeneous architecture.

5. **Community Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure shared by several organizations with common concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations).

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing offers numerous benefits to organizations:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces capital expenditure on hardware, software, and services. Pay only for what you use.

2. **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

3. **Flexibility and Agility**: Quickly provision resources to adapt to changing business needs.

4. **Global Reach**: Deploy applications globally in minutes.

5. **Reliability and High Availability**: Cloud providers offer redundant resources across multiple regions and availability zones.

6. **Security**: Major cloud providers invest heavily in security measures that many organizations couldn't afford on their own.

7. **Innovation**: Access to the latest technologies without having to invest in new hardware or software.

### Challenges and Considerations

While cloud computing offers many benefits, there are also challenges to consider:

1. **Security and Privacy**: Concerns about data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance.

2. **Dependency on Service Providers**: Reliance on the cloud provider's infrastructure and potential vendor lock-in.

3. **Network Connectivity**: Dependence on internet connectivity for accessing cloud resources.

4. **Cost Management**: While cloud can be cost-effective, improper management can lead to unexpected costs.

5. **Complexity**: Managing complex cloud environments requires specialized skills.

6. **Data Transfer and Latency**: Moving large amounts of data to and from the cloud can be time-consuming and expensive.

## Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. AWS provides IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings that enable organizations to deploy applications, manage data, and scale their infrastructure efficiently.

### AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS's global infrastructure is designed to provide high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency for cloud applications. It consists of the following components:

#### Regions

AWS Regions are separate geographic areas where AWS clusters data centers. Each region is completely independent and isolated from other regions. This isolation provides fault tolerance and stability. As of 2023, AWS operates in over 30 regions worldwide, with plans for more.

Key characteristics of AWS Regions:

- Each region consists of multiple Availability Zones.
- Regions are isolated from each other to achieve the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.
- Data stored in a specific region stays in that region unless explicitly transferred to another region.
- Not all AWS services are available in all regions.

#### Availability Zones (AZs)

Availability Zones are distinct locations within a region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.

Key characteristics of Availability Zones:

- Each region has multiple AZs (typically three or more).
- AZs within a region are connected through low-latency links.
- AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance to reduce the likelihood of simultaneous failure.
- Deploying applications across multiple AZs provides high availability and fault tolerance.

#### Edge Locations

Edge Locations are AWS data centers designed to deliver content to end users with lower latency. They are part of Amazon CloudFront, AWS's content delivery network (CDN).

Key characteristics of Edge Locations:

- Edge Locations are separate from Regions and AZs.
- They are located in major cities around the world, often more numerous than Regions.
- They cache copies of content for faster delivery to users in any location.
- Edge Locations also support AWS services like Route 53 (DNS) and AWS Shield (DDoS protection).

#### Local Zones

AWS Local Zones are a type of infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers.

Key characteristics of Local Zones:

- They are extensions of an AWS Region.
- They provide low-latency access to AWS services for specific geographic areas.
- They are ideal for latency-sensitive applications that need to be run close to end-users.

      KeyName: MyKeyPair
```

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. IAM allows you to manage users, security credentials, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.

#### IAM Core Components

1. **IAM Users**: Entities that represent people or applications that interact with AWS resources.

2. **IAM Groups**: Collections of IAM users that share the same permissions.

3. **IAM Roles**: Sets of permissions that define what actions are allowed or denied. Roles can be assumed by users, applications, or AWS services.

4. **IAM Policies**: Documents that define permissions. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.

5. **Identity Providers**: External identity systems that can be integrated with IAM, such as Active Directory, Okta, or Google.

#### IAM Best Practices

1. **Lock Away Your AWS Account Root User Access Keys**: Don't use the root account for day-to-day operations.

2. **Create Individual IAM Users**: Create individual accounts for each person who needs AWS access.

3. **Use Groups to Assign Permissions**: Manage permissions through groups rather than individual users.

4. **Grant Least Privilege**: Give users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.

5. **Configure a Strong Password Policy**: Enforce password complexity requirements.

6. **Enable MFA**: Require multi-factor authentication for all users, especially those with elevated privileges.

7. **Use Roles for Applications and AWS Services**: Use IAM roles instead of sharing credentials.

8. **Use Policy Conditions for Extra Security**: Add conditions to policies for more granular control.

9. **Regularly Review and Remove Unused Credentials**: Audit and remove unused users, roles, and credentials.

10. **Use IAM Access Analyzer**: Identify resources shared with external entities.

#### Creating and Managing IAM Users

Creating an IAM user via the AWS Management Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Users, then Add user.
3. Enter a user name.
4. Select access type (AWS Management Console access, Programmatic access, or both).
5. Set a password or generate one automatically.
6. Choose Next: Permissions.
7. Assign permissions (add to group, copy from existing user, or attach policies directly).
8. Choose Next: Tags (optional).
9. Choose Next: Review.
10. Choose Create user.

Creating an IAM user via the AWS CLI:

```bash
# Create a user
aws iam create-user --user-name MyUser

# Create access key for the user
aws iam create-access-key --user-name MyUser

# Attach a policy to the user
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name MyUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
```

#### IAM Policies

IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. A policy consists of:

- **Effect**: Whether the policy allows or denies access (Allow or Deny).
- **Action**: The specific API actions that are allowed or denied.
- **Resource**: The AWS resources to which the actions apply.
- **Condition**: Optional conditions that control when the policy is in effect.

Example IAM policy (S3 read-only access):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Types of IAM policies:

1. **AWS Managed Policies**: Predefined policies created and managed by AWS.
2. **Customer Managed Policies**: Policies that you create and manage.
3. **Inline Policies**: Policies embedded directly in a user, group, or role.

#### IAM Roles

IAM roles are similar to users but are not associated with a specific person. Roles are assumed by entities that need temporary access to AWS resources.

Common use cases for IAM roles:

1. **EC2 Instance Roles**: Grant permissions to applications running on EC2 instances.
2. **Cross-Account Access**: Allow users from one AWS account to access resources in another account.
3. **Federated User Access**: Grant access to users authenticated by an external identity provider.
4. **AWS Service Roles**: Allow AWS services to act on your behalf.

Creating an IAM role via the AWS Management Console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Roles, then Create role.
3. Choose the type of trusted entity (AWS service, Another AWS account, Web identity, or SAML 2.0 federation).
4. Configure the trust relationship.
5. Attach permissions policies.
6. Add tags (optional).
7. Review and create the role.

Creating an IAM role via the AWS CLI:

```bash
# Create a trust policy document
cat > trust-policy.json << EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Create the role
aws iam create-role --role-name MyRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json

# Attach a policy to the role
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name MyRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
```

#### IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)

IAM Identity Center provides single sign-on access to all your AWS accounts and applications. Key features include:

- **Centralized Access Management**: Manage access to multiple AWS accounts from a single place.
- **Integration with Identity Providers**: Connect to your existing identity provider (Active Directory, Okta, etc.).
- **Permission Sets**: Define sets of permissions that can be applied across accounts.
- **Application Access**: Provide single sign-on access to cloud applications.

### AWS Pricing Models and Cost Management

Understanding AWS pricing and effectively managing costs are crucial aspects of cloud engineering. AWS offers various pricing models and tools to help you optimize your spending.

#### AWS Pricing Fundamentals

AWS pricing is based on the following principles:

1. **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for the services you use, with no long-term commitments.
2. **Pay less when you reserve**: Save by committing to a minimum level of usage.
3. **Pay less when you use more**: Volume-based discounts for services like S3 and data transfer.
4. **Pay less as AWS grows**: AWS passes on savings from economies of scale to customers.

#### AWS Pricing Models

1. **On-Demand**: Pay for compute or database capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments.
   - Ideal for: Unpredictable workloads, short-term projects, testing, and development.

2. **Savings Plans**: Commit to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3-year term.
   - Types: Compute Savings Plans, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, and SageMaker Savings Plans.
   - Savings: Up to 72% compared to On-Demand pricing.

3. **Reserved Instances (RIs)**: Commit to a specific instance type in a specific region for a 1 or 3-year term.
   - Payment options: All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront.
   - Types: Standard RIs (up to 72% off) and Convertible RIs (up to 54% off with flexibility to change instance types).

4. **Spot Instances**: Request unused EC2 capacity at steep discounts (up to 90% off On-Demand prices).
   - Ideal for: Fault-tolerant, flexible workloads that can handle interruptions.
   - Limitation: AWS can reclaim Spot Instances with a 2-minute warning when capacity is needed.

5. **Dedicated Hosts**: Physical servers dedicated to your use.
   - Ideal for: Regulatory requirements, licensing that doesn't support multi-tenancy.
   - Pricing: On-Demand or Reserved pricing available.

#### AWS Free Tier

AWS Free Tier includes:

1. **12-Month Free Tier**: Services free for 12 months for new AWS customers.
2. **Always Free**: Services that are always free within certain limits.

4. Click "Create group."

5. Now, let's add our IAM user to this group. Click on the group name you just created.

6. In the "Users" tab, click "Add users."

7. Select the IAM user you created earlier and click "Add users."

### Step 5: Create a Custom IAM Policy

1. In the IAM console, click on "Policies" in the left navigation pane, then click "Create policy."

2. Click on the "JSON" tab.

3. Replace the default policy with the following JSON, which grants read-only access to Amazon S3:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Click "Next: Tags" (we'll skip adding tags for this lab).

5. Click "Next: Review."

6. Enter a name for the policy (e.g., "S3ReadOnlyAccess") and a description.

7. Click "Create policy."

### Step 6: Create an IAM Role for EC2

1. In the IAM console, click on "Roles" in the left navigation pane, then click "Create role."

2. Select "AWS service" as the trusted entity type, and choose "EC2" as the service that will use this role.

3. Click "Next: Permissions."

4. Search for and select "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" to grant read-only access to S3.

5. Click "Next: Tags" (we'll skip adding tags for this lab).

6. Click "Next: Review."

7. Enter a name for the role (e.g., "EC2-S3-ReadOnly") and a description.

8. Click "Create role."

### Step 7: Explore the AWS Management Console

1. Sign out of the root account and sign in using your IAM user credentials and the sign-in URL you noted earlier.

2. Take some time to explore the AWS Management Console. Key areas to explore:

   - **Navigation Bar**: Access services, create resources, and search for services.
   - **Resource Groups**: Create and manage groups of related resources.
   - **Recently Visited Services**: Quick access to services you've recently used.
   - **AWS Cost Management**: Monitor your AWS spending.
   - **AWS CloudShell**: Try out the browser-based shell for AWS CLI commands.

3. Click on "Services" in the top navigation bar to see the full list of AWS services, organized by category.

### Step 8: Set Up the AWS CLI

1. Install the AWS CLI on your local machine:

   - **For Windows**: Download and run the MSI installer from [AWS CLI Download](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi).
   - **For macOS**: Run `brew install awscli` if you have Homebrew, or download the PKG installer from [AWS CLI Download](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg).
   - **For Linux**: Run the following commands:

     ```bash
     curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
     unzip awscliv2.zip
     sudo ./aws/install
     ```

2. Configure the AWS CLI with your IAM user's access key and secret key:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   Enter the following information when prompted:
   - AWS Access Key ID: [Your IAM user's access key]
   - AWS Secret Access Key: [Your IAM user's secret key]
   - Default region name: [Your preferred region, e.g., us-east-1]
   - Default output format: [Your preferred format, e.g., json]

3. Test the AWS CLI by listing your S3 buckets:

   ```bash
   aws s3 ls
   ```

   Since you don't have any S3 buckets yet, this command won't return any results, but it should run without errors.

### Step 9: Create and Configure AWS Budget Alerts

1. In the AWS Management Console, search for "Budgets" in the search bar and select "AWS Budgets."

2. Click "Create budget."

3. Choose "Use a template (simplified)" and select "Zero spend budget" to be alerted when any costs are incurred.

4. Enter a name for your budget (e.g., "My First Budget").

5. Enter your email address in the "Email recipients" field to receive alerts.

6. Click "Create budget."

### Step 10: Clean Up

For this lab, we'll keep the IAM users, groups, policies, and roles we created, as they don't incur any costs. However, it's a good practice to clean up resources when you're done with them in real-world scenarios.

## Summary

In this chapter, we've explored the fundamentals of cloud computing and Amazon Web Services (AWS). We've learned about the different cloud service models, deployment models, and the benefits and challenges of cloud computing. We've also delved into AWS's global infrastructure, account setup and management, management interfaces, IAM, and pricing models.

Key takeaways from this chapter:

1. Cloud computing provides on-demand access to computing resources over the internet, offering benefits like cost efficiency, scalability, and flexibility.

2. AWS is the leading cloud service provider, offering a comprehensive suite of services from data centers globally.

3. AWS's global infrastructure consists of regions, availability zones, edge locations, and other specialized infrastructure to provide high availability and low latency.

4. Setting up and securing your AWS account is the first step in your cloud journey, with best practices including using IAM users instead of the root account and enabling MFA.

5. AWS provides multiple interfaces for managing your cloud resources, including the Management Console, CLI, SDKs, and CloudShell.

6. IAM is a critical service for securely controlling access to AWS resources, with components including users, groups, roles, and policies.

7. AWS offers various pricing models, including On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances, along with tools to help you manage and optimize your costs.

In the hands-on lab, we've practiced setting up an AWS account, securing the root account, creating IAM users and groups, defining custom policies, creating IAM roles, exploring the AWS Management Console, setting up the AWS CLI, and configuring budget alerts.

In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into AWS compute services, starting with Amazon EC2, the cornerstone of AWS's compute offerings.
