# Chapter 4: Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

## Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, providing a robust framework for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts.

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. It facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning "helmsman" or "pilot," and is often abbreviated as K8s (with the 8 representing the eight letters between 'K' and 's').

Kubernetes was originally developed by Google, based on their experience running containers in production with an internal system called Borg. In 2014, Google open-sourced Kubernetes, and it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### Key Features of Kubernetes

1. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Kubernetes can expose a container using a DNS name or its own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute the network traffic.

2. **Storage Orchestration**: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers, and more.

3. **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers, and Kubernetes can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

4. **Automatic Bin Packing**: You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs, and Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources.

5. **Self-healing**: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.

6. **Secret and Configuration Management**: Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images.

### Kubernetes Architecture Components

Kubernetes follows a client-server architecture, with a master node (control plane) managing worker nodes. Let's explore the key components:

#### Control Plane Components (Master Node)

1. **kube-apiserver**: The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and is designed to scale horizontally.

2. **etcd**: A consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

3. **kube-scheduler**: Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.

4. **kube-controller-manager**: Runs controller processes. These controllers include:
   - Node Controller: Notices and responds when nodes go down.
   - Replication Controller: Maintains the correct number of pods for every replication controller object.
   - Endpoints Controller: Populates the Endpoints object (joins Services & Pods).
   - Service Account & Token Controllers: Create default accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces.

5. **cloud-controller-manager**: Links your cluster into your cloud provider's API, separating the components that interact with the cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.

#### Node Components (Worker Nodes)

1. **kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.

2. **kube-proxy**: A network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.

3. **Container Runtime**: The software responsible for running containers, such as Docker, containerd, CRI-O, or any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).

### Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Here are some of the most important Kubernetes objects:

1. **Pod**: The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model. A Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster.

2. **Service**: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

3. **Volume**: A directory containing data, accessible to the containers in a pod.

4. **Namespace**: A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users.

5. **Deployment**: Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

6. **StatefulSet**: Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

7. **DaemonSet**: Ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod.

8. **Job**: Creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate.

9. **CronJob**: Creates Jobs on a repeating schedule.

10. **ConfigMap**: Allows you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.

11. **Secret**: Similar to ConfigMaps but specifically intended to hold confidential data.

12. **Ingress**: Manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

13. **PersistentVolume**: A piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.

14. **PersistentVolumeClaim**: A request for storage by a user.

### Kubernetes Networking

Kubernetes networking addresses four primary concerns:

1. **Container-to-Container Communication**: Containers within a Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost.

2. **Pod-to-Pod Communication**: All Pods can communicate with all other Pods without NAT. This is typically implemented using a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin.

3. **Pod-to-Service Communication**: Services abstract Pod access, allowing for load balancing and service discovery.

4. **External-to-Service Communication**: External traffic can access Services through NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress resources.

### Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm

While both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are container orchestration platforms, they have different approaches and capabilities:

| Feature | Kubernetes | Docker Swarm |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Installation & Setup | More complex | Simpler |
| Scalability | Highly scalable | Less scalable |
| Auto-scaling | Supported | Limited support |
| Load Balancing | Manual configuration required | Automatic |
| Rolling Updates | Supported | Supported |
| Self-healing | Comprehensive | Basic |
| Service Discovery | DNS-based | DNS-based |
| GUI | Dashboard available | None (uses Docker CLI) |
| Learning Curve | Steeper | Gentler |
| Community Support | Extensive | Limited |

## Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster

There are several ways to set up a Kubernetes cluster, depending on your needs and environment. We'll explore different options, from local development clusters to production-ready setups.

### Local Development Clusters

For development and testing purposes, you can set up a local Kubernetes cluster using tools like Minikube, kind, or Docker Desktop.

#### Option 1: Minikube

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. It runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop.

**Prerequisites**:
- VirtualBox, Hyper-V, KVM2, or Docker
- kubectl
- 2 CPUs or more
- 2GB of free memory
- 20GB of free disk space

**Installation**:

```bash
brew install minikube
```

For Windows (with Chocolatey):
```bash
choco install minikube
```

For Linux:
```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

**Starting Minikube**:
```bash
minikube start
```

**Verifying Installation**:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

**Accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard**:
```bash
minikube dashboard
```

curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.11.1/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

**Creating a Cluster**:
```bash
kind create cluster
```

**Verifying Installation**:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

**Deleting the Cluster**:
```bash
kind delete cluster
```

#### Option 3: Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac comes with Kubernetes support built-in.

**Enabling Kubernetes in Docker Desktop**:
1. Open Docker Desktop settings
2. Go to the Kubernetes tab
3. Check "Enable Kubernetes"
4. Click "Apply & Restart"

**Verifying Installation**:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Production Clusters

For production environments, you'll want a more robust and scalable Kubernetes setup. Here are some options:

#### Option 1: Managed Kubernetes Services

Cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes services that handle the complexity of setting up and maintaining a Kubernetes cluster:

- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
- **DigitalOcean Kubernetes**
- **IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service**

These services provide features like automatic upgrades, scaling, and integration with cloud provider services.

#### Option 2: kubeadm

kubeadm is a tool built to provide best-practice "fast paths" for creating Kubernetes clusters. It performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running.

**Prerequisites**:
- Multiple machines running a compatible Linux distribution (Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS 7, etc.)
- 2 GB or more of RAM per machine
- 2 CPUs or more on the master node
- Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster

**Installation**:

1. Install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl on all nodes:
   ```bash
   # Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

   # Download the Google Cloud public signing key
   sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

   # Add the Kubernetes apt repository
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

   # Update apt package index, install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, and pin their version
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   ```

2. Initialize the master node:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
   ```

3. Set up kubectl access:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
   ```

4. Install a pod network add-on (e.g., Calico):
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
   ```

5. Join worker nodes to the cluster:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm join <master-ip>:<master-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
   ```

6. Verify the cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

#### Option 3: Kubernetes The Hard Way

For a deeper understanding of how Kubernetes works, you can follow "Kubernetes The Hard Way" by Kelsey Hightower. This guide walks through setting up Kubernetes from scratch without using any automated tools.

[Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

### Installing and Configuring kubectl

kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It's essential for managing your Kubernetes resources.

**Installation**:

For macOS:
```bash
brew install kubectl
```

For Windows (with Chocolatey):
```bash
choco install kubernetes-cli
```

For Linux:
```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

**Configuring kubectl**:

kubectl uses a configuration file located at `~/.kube/config` by default. This file contains information about clusters, users, and contexts.

To view your current configuration:
```bash
kubectl config view
```

To set a specific context:
```bash
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
```

To add a new cluster to your configuration:
```bash
kubectl config set-cluster <cluster-name> --server=<server-url> --certificate-authority=<ca-file>
```

To add a new user:
```bash
kubectl config set-credentials <user-name> --client-certificate=<cert-file> --client-key=<key-file>
```

To create a new context:
```bash
kubectl config set-context <context-name> --cluster=<cluster-name> --user=<user-name> --namespace=<namespace>
```

### Setting Up a Kubernetes Dashboard

The Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the cluster resources.

**Deployment**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.5.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

**Creating an Admin User**:

1. Create a service account:
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ServiceAccount
   metadata:
     name: admin-user
     namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
   EOF
   ```

2. Create a cluster role binding:
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: admin-user
   roleRef:
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     kind: ClusterRole
     name: cluster-admin
   subjects:
   - kind: ServiceAccount
     name: admin-user
     namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
   EOF
   ```

3. Get the token for the admin user:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get sa/admin-user -o jsonpath="{.secrets[0].name}") -o go-template="{{.data.token | base64decode}}"
   ```

**Accessing the Dashboard**:
```bash
kubectl proxy
```

Then open the following URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/

Enter the token obtained earlier to log in.

## Deployments, Services, and Pods

In Kubernetes, Deployments, Services, and Pods are fundamental objects that work together to run and expose your applications. Let's explore each of these in detail.

### Pods

A Pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.

Pods contain one or more containers, such as Docker containers. When a Pod runs multiple containers, the containers are managed as a single entity and share the Pod's resources, including:

- Shared storage, as Volumes
- Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
- Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

#### Pod Lifecycle

Pods have a defined lifecycle:
1. **Pending**: The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the containers has not been created.
2. **Running**: The Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
3. **Succeeded**: All containers in the Pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
4. **Failed**: All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure.
5. **Unknown**: For some reason, the state of the Pod could not be obtained.

#### Creating a Pod

Here's an example of a Pod manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.19
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

To create the Pod:
```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

#### Pod Commands

```bash
# List all pods
kubectl get pods

# Get detailed information about a pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Get pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Execute a command in a pod
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash

# Delete a pod
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
```

### Deployments

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

Deployments are recommended for stateless applications where any Pod can be replaced by another identical Pod.

#### Key Features of Deployments

1. **Scaling**: You can scale the number of replicas up or down.
2. **Rolling Updates**: You can update the application without downtime.
3. **Rollbacks**: You can roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong.
4. **Self-healing**: If a Pod fails, the Deployment automatically replaces it.

#### Creating a Deployment

Here's an example of a Deployment manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.19
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

To create the Deployment:
```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

#### Deployment Commands

```bash
# List all deployments
kubectl get deployments

# Get detailed information about a deployment
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>

# Scale a deployment
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=5

# Update a deployment
kubectl set image deployment/<deployment-name> <container-name>=<new-image>

# Roll back a deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>

# Check rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>

# View rollout history
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>

# Delete a deployment
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>
```

### Services

A Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes, you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

#### Types of Services

1. **ClusterIP**: Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. This is the default ServiceType.
2. **NodePort**: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port.
3. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
4. **ExternalName**: Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g., foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record.

#### Creating a Service

Here's an example of a Service manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

To create the Service:
```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

#### Service Commands

```bash
# List all services
kubectl get services

# Get detailed information about a service
kubectl describe service <service-name>

# Delete a service
kubectl delete service <service-name>
```

### Putting It All Together

Let's create a complete application with a Deployment and a Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
  labels:
    app: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: nginx:1.19
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: web-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

To create both resources:
```bash
kubectl apply -f web-app.yaml
```

## ConfigMaps and Secrets

ConfigMaps and Secrets are Kubernetes objects that allow you to decouple configuration from your application code, making your applications more portable.

### ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps allow you to store configuration data as key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.

#### Creating a ConfigMap

There are several ways to create a ConfigMap:

1. **From literal values**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_ENV=production --from-literal=APP_DEBUG=false
   ```

2. **From a file**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=config.properties
   ```

3. **From a directory**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=config/
   ```

4. **Using a YAML manifest**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: app-config
   data:
     APP_ENV: production
     APP_DEBUG: "false"
     config.properties: |
       app.name=MyApp
       app.version=1.0.0
   ```

#### Using ConfigMaps in Pods

1. **As environment variables**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: app-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: app
       image: myapp:1.0
       env:
       - name: APP_ENV
         valueFrom:
           configMapKeyRef:
             name: app-config
             key: APP_ENV
       - name: APP_DEBUG
         valueFrom:
           configMapKeyRef:
             name: app-config
             key: APP_DEBUG
   ```

2. **As command-line arguments**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: app-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: app
       image: myapp:1.0
       command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
       args: ["echo $(APP_ENV) $(APP_DEBUG)"]
       env:
       - name: APP_ENV
         valueFrom:
           configMapKeyRef:
             name: app-config
             key: APP_ENV
       - name: APP_DEBUG
         valueFrom:
           configMapKeyRef:
             name: app-config
             key: APP_DEBUG
   ```

3. **As a volume**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: app-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: app
       image: myapp:1.0
       volumeMounts:
       - name: config-volume
         mountPath: /etc/config
     volumes:
     - name: config-volume
       configMap:
         name: app-config
   ```

### Secrets

Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps but are specifically intended for confidential data such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. Secrets are stored in etcd in an encoded form.

#### Types of Secrets

1. **Opaque**: Arbitrary user-defined data (default).
2. **kubernetes.io/service-account-token**: Service account token.
3. **kubernetes.io/dockercfg**: Serialized ~/.dockercfg file.
4. **kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson**: Serialized ~/.docker/config.json file.
5. **kubernetes.io/basic-auth**: Credentials for basic authentication.
6. **kubernetes.io/ssh-auth**: SSH credentials.
7. **kubernetes.io/tls**: TLS data.
8. **bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token**: Bootstrap token data.

#### Creating a Secret

1. **From literal values**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic db-credentials --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=password123
   ```

2. **From files**:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic tls-certs --from-file=cert.pem --from-file=key.pem
   ```

3. **Using a YAML manifest**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: db-credentials
   type: Opaque
   data:
     username: YWRtaW4=  # base64 encoded "admin"
     password: cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=  # base64 encoded "password123"
   ```

#### Using Secrets in Pods

1. **As environment variables**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: app-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: app
       image: myapp:1.0
       env:
       - name: DB_USERNAME
         valueFrom:
           secretKeyRef:
             name: db-credentials
             key: username
       - name: DB_PASSWORD
         valueFrom:
           secretKeyRef:
             name: db-credentials
             key: password
   ```

2. **As a volume**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: app-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: app
       image: myapp:1.0
       volumeMounts:
       - name: secret-volume
         mountPath: /etc/secrets
         readOnly: true
     volumes:
     - name: secret-volume
       secret:
         secretName: db-credentials
   ```

### Best Practices for ConfigMaps and Secrets

1. **Avoid storing sensitive data in ConfigMaps**: Use Secrets for sensitive data.
2. **Use environment variables for simple configurations**: Environment variables are easier to manage for simple configurations.
3. **Use volumes for complex configurations**: Volumes are better for complex configurations or when you need to update the configuration without restarting the Pod.
4. **Consider using external secret management tools**: For production environments, consider using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
5. **Rotate secrets regularly**: Implement a process to regularly rotate secrets.
6. **Limit access to Secrets**: Use RBAC to limit who can access Secrets.
7. **Encrypt Secrets at rest**: Enable encryption at rest for etcd to protect Secrets.

## Persistent Volumes

In Kubernetes, Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) provide a way to use storage resources in a cluster. PVs are storage resources in the cluster that have been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. PVCs are requests for storage by a user.

### Persistent Volume (PV)

A PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource.

#### Creating a Persistent Volume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-example
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: standard
  hostPath:
    path: /data/pv-example
```

#### PV Access Modes

- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
- **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: The volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes.
- **ReadWriteMany (RWX)**: The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

#### PV Reclaim Policies

- **Retain**: When the PVC is deleted, the PV still exists and the volume is considered "released". But it is not yet available for another claim because the previous claimant's data remains on the volume.
- **Delete**: When the PVC is deleted, both the PV and the associated storage asset are deleted.
- **Recycle**: When the PVC is deleted, the volume is scrubbed before being made available again.

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

A PVC is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod in that Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources.

#### Creating a Persistent Volume Claim

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-example
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: standard
```

#### Using a PVC in a Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-pvc
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:1.0
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data-volume
      mountPath: /data
  volumes:
  - name: data-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-example
```

### Storage Classes

Storage Classes provide a way to describe the "classes" of storage offered by the cluster. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or arbitrary policies determined by the cluster administrators.

#### Creating a Storage Class

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

#### Dynamic Provisioning

With Storage Classes, you can enable dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes. When a PVC requests a Storage Class, a PV is automatically created to fulfill the claim.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: dynamic-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: fast
```

### StatefulSets

StatefulSets are designed to work with stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage. Unlike Deployments, StatefulSets maintain a sticky identity for each of their Pods.

#### Creating a StatefulSet

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.19
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "standard"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

#### Key Features of StatefulSets

1. **Stable, unique network identifiers**: Each Pod in a StatefulSet derives its hostname from the name of the StatefulSet and the ordinal of the Pod.
2. **Stable, persistent storage**: Each Pod can have its own PVC.
3. **Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling**: Pods are created in order (from 0 to N-1) and terminated in reverse order.
4. **Ordered, automated rolling updates**: Updates to StatefulSets are performed in the same order as Pod termination.

## Helm Charts

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. Helm uses a packaging format called charts, which are collections of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.

### What is Helm?

Helm is often referred to as the "package manager for Kubernetes." It simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes by providing:

1. **Package Management**: Helm packages applications into charts, which contain all the resource definitions needed to run an application on Kubernetes.
2. **Release Management**: Helm tracks releases, allowing you to roll back to previous versions.
3. **Dependency Management**: Helm manages dependencies between charts.

### Helm Architecture

Helm has a client-server architecture:

1. **Helm Client**: The command-line client that sends commands to the Kubernetes API server.
2. **Kubernetes API Server**: Interacts with the Kubernetes cluster.

In Helm 3, the Tiller server component was removed, and Helm now interacts directly with the Kubernetes API server.

### Installing Helm

For macOS:
```bash
brew install helm
```

For Windows (with Chocolatey):
```bash
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

For Linux:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

### Helm Commands

```bash
# Add a repository
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable

# Update repositories
helm repo update

# Search for charts
helm search repo stable

# Install a chart
helm install my-release stable/mysql

# List releases
helm list

# Upgrade a release
helm upgrade my-release stable/mysql --set mysqlPassword=password123

# Rollback a release
helm rollback my-release 1

# Uninstall a release
helm uninstall my-release

# Create a new chart
helm create my-chart
```

### Helm Chart Structure

A Helm chart is organized as a collection of files inside a directory. The directory name is the name of the chart.

```
mychart/
  Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart
  values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart
  charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends
  templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values, will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files
  templates/NOTES.txt # A plain text file containing usage notes
```

### Creating a Helm Chart

Let's create a simple Helm chart for a web application:

```bash
# Create a new chart
helm create webapp

# Explore the chart structure
ls -la webapp/
```

The `webapp` directory will contain the following files and directories:
- `Chart.yaml`: Contains metadata about the chart
- `values.yaml`: Contains default values for the chart
- `templates/`: Contains the template files
- `charts/`: Contains any dependent charts
- `.helmignore`: Specifies files to ignore when packaging the chart

Let's modify the chart to deploy a simple web application:

1. Edit `Chart.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v2
   name: webapp
   description: A Helm chart for a simple web application
   type: application
   version: 0.1.0
   appVersion: 1.0.0
   ```

2. Edit `values.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   replicaCount: 2

   image:
     repository: nginx
     tag: "1.19"
     pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

   service:
     type: ClusterIP
     port: 80

   ingress:
     enabled: false

   resources:
     limits:
       cpu: 100m
       memory: 128Mi
     requests:
       cpu: 50m
       memory: 64Mi
   ```

3. The `templates` directory already contains template files for a deployment, service, ingress, etc. You can customize these files as needed.

4. Install the chart:
   ```bash
   helm install my-webapp ./webapp
   ```

5. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   ```

### Customizing Chart Values

You can customize the values used by a chart in several ways:

1. **Modify values.yaml**: Edit the `values.yaml` file directly.
2. **Use --set flag**: Specify values on the command line.
   ```bash
   helm install my-webapp ./webapp --set replicaCount=3
   ```
3. **Use a values file**: Create a separate values file and use the `-f` flag.
   ```bash
   # Create a values file
   cat > my-values.yaml << EOF
   replicaCount: 3
   service:
     type: NodePort
   EOF

   # Install the chart with the values file
   helm install my-webapp ./webapp -f my-values.yaml
   ```

### Helm Chart Repositories

Helm charts can be stored in chart repositories, which are HTTP servers that house packaged charts.

1. **Add a repository**:
   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   ```

2. **Update repositories**:
   ```bash
   helm repo update
   ```

3. **Search for charts**:
   ```bash
   helm search repo bitnami
   ```

4. **Install a chart from a repository**:
   ```bash
   helm install my-wordpress bitnami/wordpress
   ```

### Creating a Chart Repository

You can create your own chart repository to share charts within your organization:

1. **Package your chart**:
   ```bash
   helm package ./webapp
   ```

2. **Create an index file**:
   ```bash
   helm repo index .
   ```

3. **Host the repository**: You can host the repository on any HTTP server, such as GitHub Pages, S3, or a web server.

4. **Add your repository**:
   ```bash
   helm repo add myrepo https://example.com/charts
   ```

## Kubernetes Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster. They help you understand what's happening in your cluster, troubleshoot issues, and make informed decisions.

### Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, while Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.

#### Installing Prometheus and Grafana using Helm

```bash
# Add the Prometheus community Helm repository
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

# Update repositories
helm repo update

# Install Prometheus and Grafana
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

#### Accessing Grafana

```bash
# Port forward to access Grafana
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80

# Get the Grafana admin password
kubectl get secret prometheus-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Log in with the username `admin` and the password obtained above.

#### Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints. Some of the key metrics it collects include:

1. **Node Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network traffic.
2. **Pod Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic.
3. **Container Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage.
4. **API Server Metrics**: Request latency, request count.
5. **etcd Metrics**: Disk operations, network operations.

#### Grafana Dashboards

Grafana allows you to create dashboards to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. The kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart includes several pre-configured dashboards:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Overview of the entire cluster.
2. **Kubernetes Compute Resources**: CPU and memory usage by namespace, pod, etc.
3. **Kubernetes Networking**: Network traffic by namespace, pod, etc.
4. **Nodes**: Detailed metrics for each node.
5. **Pods**: Detailed metrics for each pod.

### Logging with ELK Stack

The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is a popular logging solution for Kubernetes.

#### Installing ELK Stack using Helm

```bash
# Add the Elastic Helm repository
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co

# Update repositories
helm repo update

# Install Elasticsearch
helm install elasticsearch elastic/elasticsearch

# Install Kibana
helm install kibana elastic/kibana

# Install Filebeat
helm install filebeat elastic/filebeat
```

#### Accessing Kibana

```bash
# Port forward to access Kibana
kubectl port-forward svc/kibana-kibana 5601:5601
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5601`.

#### Log Collection

Filebeat collects logs from the following sources:

1. **Container Logs**: Logs from containers running on Kubernetes.
2. **Kubernetes Logs**: Logs from Kubernetes components like the API server, scheduler, etc.
3. **System Logs**: Logs from the underlying operating system.

#### Log Visualization in Kibana

Kibana allows you to search, visualize, and analyze your logs. You can:

1. **Search Logs**: Use the Kibana Query Language (KQL) to search for specific log entries.
2. **Create Visualizations**: Create charts, graphs, and other visualizations based on your logs.
3. **Build Dashboards**: Combine visualizations into dashboards for a comprehensive view of your system.
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts to notify you when certain conditions are met.

### Custom Metrics with Prometheus Operator

The Prometheus Operator provides Kubernetes native deployment and management of Prometheus and related monitoring components. It includes custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining Prometheus instances, ServiceMonitors, and AlertmanagerConfigs.

#### Creating a ServiceMonitor

A ServiceMonitor defines how a service should be monitored:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: example-app
  labels:
    team: frontend
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  endpoints:
  - port: web
    interval: 15s
```

#### Creating a PrometheusRule

A PrometheusRule defines alerting rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: example-app-alerts
  labels:
    prometheus: example
    role: alert-rules
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example-app.rules
    rules:
    - alert: ExampleAppDown
      expr: up{job="example-app"} == 0
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: critical
      annotations:
        summary: "Example app is down"
        description: "Example app has been down for more than 5 minutes."
```

## Hands-On Exercise: Deploying a Microservices Application on Kubernetes

In this exercise, we'll deploy a microservices application on Kubernetes. The application consists of a frontend service, a backend API, and a database.

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, kind, or a cloud provider's managed Kubernetes service)
- kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster
- Helm installed

### Step 1: Create a Namespace

Let's create a namespace for our application:

```bash
kubectl create namespace microservices-demo
```

### Step 2: Deploy MongoDB

We'll use Helm to deploy MongoDB:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb --namespace microservices-demo --set auth.rootPassword=password123
```

### Step 3: Create a ConfigMap for the Backend API

Create a file named `backend-config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: backend-config
  namespace: microservices-demo
data:
  NODE_ENV: "production"
  PORT: "3000"
  MONGO_URI: "mongodb://root:password123@mongodb.microservices-demo.svc.cluster.local:27017/microservices-demo?authSource=admin"
```

Apply the ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl apply -f backend-config.yaml
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Backend API

Create a file named `backend-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: microservices-demo
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: node:14-alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - |
          mkdir -p /app
          cd /app
          echo 'const express = require("express");
          const mongoose = require("mongoose");
          const cors = require("cors");
          
          const app = express();
          const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
          const mongoUri = process.env.MONGO_URI;
          
          app.use(cors());
          app.use(express.json());
          
          mongoose.connect(mongoUri, {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true,
          })
          .then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
          .catch((err) => console.error("MongoDB connection error:", err));
          
          const itemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
            name: String,
            description: String,
            createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
          });
          
          const Item = mongoose.model("Item", itemSchema);
          
          app.get("/api/items", async (req, res) => {
            try {
              const items = await Item.find().sort({ createdAt: -1 });
              res.json(items);
            } catch (err) {
              res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
            }
          });
          
          app.post("/api/items", async (req, res) => {
            try {
              const item = new Item(req.body);
              await item.save();
              res.status(201).json(item);
            } catch (err) {
              res.status(400).json({ error: err.message });
            }
          });
          
          app.get("/api/health", (req, res) => {
            res.json({ status: "ok" });
          });
          
          app.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
          });' > server.js
          
          npm init -y
          npm install express mongoose cors
          node server.js
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: backend-config
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /api/health
            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /api/health
            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 10
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: microservices-demo
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
  type: ClusterIP
```

Apply the Deployment and Service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
```

### Step 5: Deploy the Frontend

Create a file named `frontend-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: microservices-demo
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: node:14-alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - |
          mkdir -p /app
          cd /app
          echo '<!DOCTYPE html>

                color: white;
                padding: 10px 15px;
                border: none;
                cursor: pointer;
              }
              .item {

          echo 'const express = require("express");
          const { createProxyMiddleware } = require("http-proxy-middleware");
          
          const app = express();
          const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;
          
          // Serve static files

            changeOrigin: true,
            pathRewrite: {
              "^/api": "/api",
            },
          }));
          
          app.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`Frontend server running on port ${port}`);
          });' > server.js
          
          mkdir -p public
          mv index.html public/
          
          npm init -y
          npm install express http-proxy-middleware
          node server.js
        env:
        - name: PORT
          value: "8080"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: microservices-demo
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Apply the Deployment and Service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

If you're using Minikube, you can access the application using the `minikube service` command:

```bash
minikube service frontend -n microservices-demo
```

If you're using a cloud provider's managed Kubernetes service, you can get the external IP of the frontend service:

```bash
kubectl get service frontend -n microservices-demo
```

### Step 7: Scale the Application

Let's scale the backend deployment to handle more traffic:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment backend -n microservices-demo --replicas=3
```

### Step 8: Update the Application

Let's update the backend to add a new feature:

```bash
kubectl edit deployment backend -n microservices-demo
```

In the editor, find the `args` section and add a new endpoint to the server.js file:

```
app.delete("/api/items/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const item = await Item.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
    if (!item) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: "Item not found" });
    }
    res.json({ message: "Item deleted" });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});
```

Save and exit the editor. Kubernetes will automatically roll out the update.

### Step 9: Monitor the Application

Let's set up monitoring for our application using Prometheus and Grafana:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

Create a ServiceMonitor for our backend service:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: backend-monitor
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - microservices-demo
  endpoints:
  - port: http
    interval: 15s
```

Apply the ServiceMonitor:

```bash
kubectl apply -f backend-monitor.yaml
```

Access Grafana to view the metrics:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Log in with the username `admin` and the password `prom-operator`.

## Summary

In this chapter, we've explored Kubernetes, a powerful platform for container orchestration. We've covered the architecture of Kubernetes, how to set up a cluster, and how to deploy, manage, and scale applications using Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Persistent Volumes.

We've also looked at more advanced topics like Helm Charts for package management and monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack. Finally, we've completed a hands-on exercise to deploy a microservices application on Kubernetes.

Key takeaways from this chapter:

1. Kubernetes provides a robust platform for orchestrating containerized applications.
2. Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets help you manage your applications.
3. Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims provide storage for your applications.
4. Helm simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes.
5. Monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster.

In the next chapter, we'll dive into Infrastructure as Code, exploring how to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure using tools like Terraform and Ansible.
