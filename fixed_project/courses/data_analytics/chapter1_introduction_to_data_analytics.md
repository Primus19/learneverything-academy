   ```python
   # Create a structured dataset of sales data
   data = {
       'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
       'Product': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C'],
       'Region': ['North', 'North', 'South', 'South', 'East', 'East', 'West', 'West', 'North', 'South'],
       'Sales': [100, 200, 150, 300, 250, 175, 225, 275, 180, 320],
       'Units': [10, 15, 12, 20, 18, 14, 16, 19, 13, 22]
   }
   
   # Convert to DataFrame
   sales_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   
   # Display the data
   print("Structured Sales Data:")
   display(sales_df)
   
   # Examine data types
   print("\nData Types:")
   display(sales_df.dtypes)
   
   # Basic statistics
   print("\nSummary Statistics:")
   display(sales_df.describe())
   ```

2. **Work with semi-structured data**
   - Create and explore a JSON-like dataset:
   ```python
   # Create semi-structured data (JSON-like)
   semi_structured = [
       {
           "customer_id": 1001,
           "name": "John Smith",
           "purchases": [
               {"product": "Laptop", "price": 1200, "date": "2023-01-15"},
               {"product": "Mouse", "price": 25, "date": "2023-01-15"}
           ],
           "contact": {
               "email": "john@example.com",
               "phone": "555-1234"
           }
       },
       {
           "customer_id": 1002,
           "name": "Jane Doe",
           "purchases": [
               {"product": "Monitor", "price": 350, "date": "2023-01-20"}
           ],
           "contact": {
               "email": "jane@example.com"
               # Note: No phone number
           }
       },
       {
           "customer_id": 1003,
           "name": "Bob Johnson",
           "purchases": [],  # No purchases
           "contact": {
               "email": "bob@example.com",
               "phone": "555-5678"
           }
       }
   ]
   
   # Display the semi-structured data
   print("Semi-structured Customer Data:")
   import json
   print(json.dumps(semi_structured, indent=2))
   
   # Convert to a more structured format
   customers = []
   purchases = []
   
   for customer in semi_structured:
       # Extract customer info
       customer_info = {
           'customer_id': customer['customer_id'],
           'name': customer['name'],
           'email': customer['contact']['email'],
           'phone': customer['contact'].get('phone', 'N/A')  # Handle missing phone
       }
       customers.append(customer_info)
       
       # Extract purchase info
       for purchase in customer['purchases']:
           purchase_info = {
               'customer_id': customer['customer_id'],
               'product': purchase['product'],
               'price': purchase['price'],
               'date': purchase['date']
           }
           purchases.append(purchase_info)
   
   # Create DataFrames
   customers_df = pd.DataFrame(customers)
   purchases_df = pd.DataFrame(purchases)
   
   print("\nStructured Customer Data:")
   display(customers_df)
   
   print("\nStructured Purchase Data:")
   display(purchases_df)
   ```

3. **Simulate unstructured data analysis**
   - Create a text analysis example:
   ```python
   # Simulate unstructured text data (customer reviews)
   reviews = [
       "The product was excellent and exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!",
       "Decent quality but shipping took too long. Customer service was helpful though.",
       "Terrible experience. The product broke after one week and returns were difficult.",
       "Good value for the price. Would buy again from this company.",
       "Average product, nothing special but does the job. Fast shipping."
   ]
   
   print("Unstructured Text Data (Customer Reviews):")
   for i, review in enumerate(reviews, 1):
       print(f"Review {i}: {review}")
   
   # Simple text analysis
   # Count words in each review
   word_counts = [len(review.split()) for review in reviews]
   
   # Simple sentiment analysis (very basic)
   positive_words = ['excellent', 'good', 'great', 'recommended', 'helpful', 'fast']
   negative_words = ['terrible', 'broke', 'difficult', 'too long', 'nothing special']
   
   sentiments = []
   for review in reviews:
       review_lower = review.lower()
       positive_score = sum(1 for word in positive_words if word in review_lower)
       negative_score = sum(1 for word in negative_words if word in review_lower)
       sentiment = positive_score - negative_score
       sentiments.append(sentiment)
   
   # Create a DataFrame with the analysis
   review_analysis = pd.DataFrame({
       'Review': reviews,
       'Word_Count': word_counts,
       'Sentiment_Score': sentiments
   })
   
   print("\nBasic Text Analysis:")
   display(review_analysis)
   ```

### Step 3: Perform Descriptive Analytics

1. **Calculate summary statistics**
   - Analyze the sales data:
   ```python
   # Summary statistics for numerical columns
   print("Summary Statistics for Sales Data:")
   display(sales_df[['Sales', 'Units']].describe())
   
   # Group by analysis
   print("\nSales by Product:")
   product_sales = sales_df.groupby('Product').agg({
       'Sales': ['sum', 'mean', 'count'],
       'Units': ['sum', 'mean']
   })
   display(product_sales)
   
   print("\nSales by Region:")
   region_sales = sales_df.groupby('Region').agg({
       'Sales': ['sum', 'mean', 'count'],
       'Units': ['sum', 'mean']
   })
   display(region_sales)
   
   # Calculate derived metrics
   sales_df['Revenue_per_Unit'] = sales_df['Sales'] / sales_df['Units']
   
   print("\nRevenue per Unit Statistics:")
   display(sales_df['Revenue_per_Unit'].describe())
   ```

2. **Identify patterns and trends**
   - Analyze time-based patterns:
   ```python
   # Time-based analysis
   sales_df['Day_of_Week'] = sales_df['Date'].dt.day_name()
   
   print("Sales by Day of Week:")
   day_sales = sales_df.groupby('Day_of_Week').agg({
       'Sales': ['sum', 'mean'],
       'Units': ['sum', 'mean']
   })
   display(day_sales)
   
   # Calculate cumulative sales
   sales_df['Cumulative_Sales'] = sales_df['Sales'].cumsum()
   
   print("\nDaily and Cumulative Sales:")
   display(sales_df[['Date', 'Sales', 'Cumulative_Sales']])
   ```

3. **Perform correlation analysis**
   - Examine relationships between variables:
   ```python
   # Correlation analysis
   correlation = sales_df[['Sales', 'Units', 'Revenue_per_Unit']].corr()
   
   print("Correlation Matrix:")
   display(correlation)
   
   # Create a heatmap of correlations
   plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
   sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', vmin=-1, vmax=1)
   plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Sales Variables')
   plt.show()
   ```

### Step 4: Create Basic Visualizations

1. **Create bar charts for categorical data**
   ```python
   # Bar chart of sales by product
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.barplot(x='Product', y='Sales', data=sales_df)
   plt.title('Total Sales by Product')
   plt.xlabel('Product')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   plt.show()
   
   # Bar chart of sales by region
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.barplot(x='Region', y='Sales', data=sales_df)
   plt.title('Total Sales by Region')
   plt.xlabel('Region')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Create time series plots**
   ```python
   # Time series plot of sales
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
   plt.plot(sales_df['Date'], sales_df['Sales'], marker='o', linestyle='-')
   plt.title('Daily Sales Over Time')
   plt.xlabel('Date')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   plt.grid(True)
   plt.xticks(rotation=45)
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   
   # Time series plot of cumulative sales
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
   plt.plot(sales_df['Date'], sales_df['Cumulative_Sales'], marker='o', linestyle='-')
   plt.title('Cumulative Sales Over Time')
   plt.xlabel('Date')
   plt.ylabel('Cumulative Sales ($)')
   plt.grid(True)
   plt.xticks(rotation=45)
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Create scatter plots for relationships**
   ```python
   # Scatter plot of sales vs. units
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.scatterplot(x='Units', y='Sales', hue='Product', size='Revenue_per_Unit', 
                  sizes=(50, 200), data=sales_df)
   plt.title('Relationship Between Units Sold and Sales Revenue')
   plt.xlabel('Units Sold')
   plt.ylabel('Sales Revenue ($)')
   plt.grid(True)
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Create pie charts for composition**
   ```python
   # Pie chart of sales by product
   product_totals = sales_df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum()
   
   plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
   plt.pie(product_totals, labels=product_totals.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', 
          startangle=90, shadow=True)
   plt.title('Sales Distribution by Product')
   plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle
   plt.show()
   
   # Pie chart of sales by region
   region_totals = sales_df.groupby('Region')['Sales'].sum()
   
   plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
   plt.pie(region_totals, labels=region_totals.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', 
          startangle=90, shadow=True)
   plt.title('Sales Distribution by Region')
   plt.axis('equal')
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Create a final visualization dashboard**
   ```python
   # Create a dashboard of key visualizations
   plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))
   
   # Sales by product
   plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
   sns.barplot(x='Product', y='Sales', data=sales_df)
   plt.title('Sales by Product')
   plt.xlabel('Product')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   
   # Sales by region
   plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
   sns.barplot(x='Region', y='Sales', data=sales_df)
   plt.title('Sales by Region')
   plt.xlabel('Region')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   
   # Time series
   plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
   plt.plot(sales_df['Date'], sales_df['Sales'], marker='o', linestyle='-')
   plt.title('Daily Sales')
   plt.xlabel('Date')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   plt.xticks(rotation=45)
   
   # Scatter plot
   plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
   sns.scatterplot(x='Units', y='Sales', hue='Product', data=sales_df)
   plt.title('Units vs Sales')
   plt.xlabel('Units Sold')
   plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
   
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.savefig('sales_dashboard.png', dpi=300)
   plt.show()
   
   print("Dashboard saved as 'sales_dashboard.png'")
   ```

### Lab Conclusion
In this lab, you've set up a basic data analytics environment and explored different types of data. You've performed descriptive analytics on structured data, worked with semi-structured data, and simulated analysis of unstructured text data. You've created various visualizations to communicate your findings and documented your insights in a structured format. These fundamental skills form the foundation of the data analytics process and will be built upon in subsequent chapters.

## Chapter Summary

In this introductory chapter, we explored the fundamental concepts of data analytics, providing a comprehensive foundation for the rest of the course. We began by defining data analytics and examining different types of data—structured, unstructured, and semi-structured—along with various data sources and collection methods. We then explored the complete data analytics lifecycle, from business understanding and data acquisition to modeling, deployment, and evaluation.

We distinguished between the four main types of analytics: descriptive (what happened), diagnostic (why it happened), predictive (what might happen), and prescriptive (what should be done), along with emerging cognitive analytics. We also examined various roles and career paths in the data analytics field, from core roles like data analyst and data scientist to specialized positions and leadership tracks.

The chapter concluded with an important discussion of ethical considerations in data analytics, including data privacy, bias and fairness, transparency, and governance. Through the hands-on lab, you gained practical experience setting up an analytics environment, exploring different data types, performing basic analysis, and creating visualizations.

This foundation will serve as the building blocks for the more advanced concepts and techniques we'll explore in subsequent chapters, where we'll delve deeper into data collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, and implementation.
