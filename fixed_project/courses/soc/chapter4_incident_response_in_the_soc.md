## Hands-on Lab: Incident Response Simulation

### Lab Objectives
In this hands-on lab, you will:
1. Respond to a simulated security incident
2. Create and follow an incident response playbook
3. Perform basic digital forensics
4. Document the incident and maintain chain of custody
5. Conduct a post-incident review

### Lab Requirements
- Virtual machine with at least 8GB RAM and 4 CPU cores
- Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS or later
- Internet connectivity for downloading tools
- Basic Linux command line knowledge

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/incident-response-lab
   cd ~/incident-response-lab
   ```

3. **Download lab materials**
   ```bash
   # Create directories for the lab
   mkdir -p evidence playbooks documentation logs memory disk network
   
   # Create a simple chain of custody form template
   cat > documentation/chain_of_custody.txt << 'EOF'

   ```

### Step 2: Creating an Incident Response Playbook

1. **Create a basic incident response playbook**
   ```bash
   cat > playbooks/unauthorized_access_playbook.md << 'EOF'
   # Unauthorized Access Incident Response Playbook
   
   ## Incident Overview
   This playbook addresses incidents involving unauthorized access to systems or data, including account compromise, privilege escalation, and unauthorized system access.
   
   ## Severity Classification
   - **Critical**: Access to critical systems, admin credentials compromised, active adversary
   - **High**: Access to sensitive systems, multiple accounts compromised

   - **Low**: Attempted unauthorized access, no confirmed compromise
   
   ## Required Skills and Roles
   - Incident Responder
   - System Administrator
   - Network Administrator
   - Security Analyst
   
   ## Detection Sources
   - Security monitoring alerts

### Step 4: Conducting the Incident Response Simulation

1. **Run the simulation**
   ```bash
   python3 simulate_incident.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts to work through the incident response process**

3. **Review the documentation created during the simulation**
   ```bash
   cat documentation/evidence_collection.txt
   cat documentation/incident_report.txt
   ```

### Step 5: Creating a Post-Incident Review Document

1. **Create a post-incident review document**
   ```bash
   cat > documentation/post_incident_review.md << 'EOF'
   # Post-Incident Review
   
   ## Incident Overview
   - **Incident ID**: IR-2023-001
   - **Date**: 2023-03-15
   - **Type**: Unauthorized Access and Data Exfiltration
   - **Duration**: Approximately 12 hours from initial compromise to containment
   
   ## What Went Well
   1. **Detection**: The suspicious login activity was detected by our monitoring systems
   2. **Response**: The incident response team followed the playbook effectively
   3. **Containment**: Containment actions were implemented quickly, limiting the damage
   4. **Evidence Collection**: Proper evidence collection procedures were followed
   
   ## What Could Be Improved
   1. **Prevention**: SSH brute force protection was not adequately implemented
   2. **Detection**: Data exfiltration was not detected in real-time
   3. **Response**: Some manual steps in the playbook could be automated
   4. **Recovery**: System restoration took longer than expected
   
   ## Root Causes
   1. **Technical Causes**:
      - Weak password policies
      - Lack of multi-factor authentication
      - Insufficient network segmentation
      - Missing data loss prevention controls
   
   2. **Process Causes**:
      - Incomplete security hardening procedures
      - Inadequate access review processes
      - Insufficient monitoring coverage
   
   ## Action Items
   
   | ID | Action | Owner | Priority | Due Date | Status |
   |----|--------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
   | 1 | Implement SSH key authentication | IT Ops | High | 2023-04-01 | Pending |
   | 2 | Deploy multi-factor authentication | Security | High | 2023-04-15 | Pending |
   | 3 | Enhance data exfiltration monitoring | SOC | Medium | 2023-04-30 | Pending |
   | 4 | Update incident response playbooks | IR Team | Medium | 2023-05-15 | Pending |
   | 5 | Conduct security awareness training | Training | Low | 2023-05-30 | Pending |
   
   ## Metrics
   - **Time to Detect**: 12 hours
   - **Time to Contain**: 2 hours after detection
   - **Time to Resolve**: 24 hours after detection
   - **Data Impact**: Potential exposure of confidential files
   - **System Impact**: One server compromised
   
   ## Conclusion
   This incident highlighted several security gaps in our environment, particularly around authentication security and data loss prevention. The incident response process worked effectively, but there are opportunities to improve detection capabilities and response automation. Implementing the identified action items will help prevent similar incidents in the future and improve our overall security posture.

### Lab Conclusion

In this lab, you have:
1. Created an incident response playbook for unauthorized access incidents
2. Simulated responding to a security incident involving unauthorized access and data exfiltration
3. Practiced evidence collection and documentation with chain of custody
4. Created an incident report documenting the incident details and response actions
5. Conducted a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and improvement opportunities

These activities represent the core components of the incident response process in a SOC environment. By practicing these skills in a simulated environment, you can better prepare for responding to real security incidents.

## Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we explored the critical function of incident response within a Security Operations Center. We covered:

- Incident response frameworks and lifecycle models that provide structure to the response process
- Techniques for creating effective incident response playbooks that standardize and streamline response
- Methods for classifying and prioritizing incidents to ensure appropriate resource allocation
- Strategies for containment, eradication, and recovery to minimize damage and restore operations
- Digital forensics fundamentals for collecting and analyzing evidence
- Chain of custody and evidence handling procedures to maintain evidence integrity
- Post-incident analysis and lessons learned processes to drive continuous improvement
- Tabletop exercises and testing approaches to validate response capabilities

Understanding these concepts and implementing them effectively enables SOC teams to respond to security incidents in a timely, consistent, and thorough manner. As threats continue to evolve, a well-designed incident response capability remains one of the most critical components of an organization's security program.
