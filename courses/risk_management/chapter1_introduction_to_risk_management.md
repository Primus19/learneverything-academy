## Chapter Summary

In this introductory chapter, we explored the fundamental concepts and principles of risk management. We began by defining risk and examining the core principles that guide effective risk management practices. We then traced the evolution of risk management from its historical origins to current trends and future directions.

We examined the various types of risks that organizations face, including strategic, operational, financial, compliance, external, emerging, technology, and ESG risks. Understanding these different risk categories is essential for developing a comprehensive risk management approach.

We also explored key risk management standards and frameworks, including ISO 31000, COSO ERM, and NIST RMF, comparing their approaches and applications. The risk management process was examined in detail, covering context establishment, risk identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment, monitoring, and communication.

The chapter also addressed organizational structures for risk management, examining different governance models and the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. Finally, we explored the development and implementation of risk management policies, providing practical guidance for organizations beginning their risk management journey.

Through the hands-on lab, you gained practical experience in developing core components of a risk management framework, including context analysis, policy development, assessment methodology creation, risk register design, and reporting structure establishment.

As we move forward in this course, we will build on these foundational concepts to explore more advanced risk management techniques and applications.
