     - Determine the highest impact score across dimensions
     - Calculate the risk rating (Likelihood × Impact)
     - Document the rationale for your assessment

3. **Create a risk heat map**
   - Plot all risks on a 5×5 risk matrix
   - Use the provided template to create the heat map
   - Color-code risks based on their rating:
     - Low (1-4): Green
     - Medium (5-10): Yellow
     - High (12-16): Orange
     - Extreme (20-25): Red
   - Analyze the distribution of risks on the heat map

4. **Assess control effectiveness**

## Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we explored the critical processes of risk identification and assessment, which form the foundation of effective risk management. We began by examining systematic risk identification techniques, including brainstorming, interviews, historical data analysis, process analysis, and scenario planning. We also discussed domain-specific approaches for identifying risks in strategic, operational, project, technology, cybersecurity, financial, compliance, and environmental contexts.

We then explored risk documentation practices, including risk description standards, risk register development, categorization systems, and visualization techniques. These documentation approaches ensure that identified risks are clearly communicated and managed throughout the organization.

The chapter covered both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methodologies. Qualitative methods included likelihood and impact assessment, risk matrix development, and scenario-based evaluation. Quantitative methods encompassed expected value analysis, probabilistic modeling, decision tree analysis, Value at Risk, and Bayesian analysis. We also addressed common challenges in risk assessment and their solutions.

Risk categorization was examined in detail, including taxonomy development, common risk categories, and the analysis of risk interrelationships. We explored how risks can be correlated, aggregated, and how they interact to create compounding effects.

Finally, we discussed risk prioritization frameworks, including rating-based approaches, multi-criteria decision analysis, and portfolio optimization. We examined how different stakeholder perspectives influence prioritization and how organizations can effectively balance risk and opportunity.

The hands-on lab provided practical experience in conducting a comprehensive risk assessment for a pharmaceutical drug launch project, applying the concepts and techniques covered in the chapter.
