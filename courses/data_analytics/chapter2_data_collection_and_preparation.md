## 1. Understanding Data Sources

### 1.1 Types of Data Sources

Data can come from numerous sources, each with its own characteristics and challenges:

**Primary Data Sources:**
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Interviews and focus groups
- Direct observations
- Experiments

**Secondary Data Sources:**
- Public datasets (government data, open data portals)
- Commercial databases
- Internal company records
- Web scraping and APIs
- Social media platforms

> **Knowledge Check:** What are the key differences between primary and secondary data sources? When would you choose one over the other?

### 1.2 Evaluating Data Quality

When selecting data sources, consider these critical factors:

1. **Relevance:** Does the data contain the information needed to answer your analytical questions?
2. **Accuracy:** Is the data free from errors and does it correctly represent what it claims to measure?
3. **Completeness:** Are there missing values or gaps in the dataset?
4. **Timeliness:** How recent is the data? Is it current enough for your analysis?
5. **Consistency:** Is the data collected and recorded in a uniform manner?
6. **Accessibility:** Can you legally and ethically access and use the data?

> **Hands-on Exercise:** Evaluate three potential data sources for a marketing analysis project using the quality criteria above. Document your assessment and final selection.

## 2. Data Collection Methods

### 2.1 Structured Data Collection

Structured data collection involves gathering data in a predefined format:

1. **Database Queries**
   ```sql
   -- Example SQL query to collect customer purchase data
   SELECT customer_id, product_id, purchase_date, amount
   FROM purchases
   WHERE purchase_date >= '2024-01-01'
   ORDER BY purchase_date;
   ```

2. **API Requests**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for API data collection
   import requests
   
   api_url = "https://api.example.com/data"
   response = requests.get(api_url, headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"})
   
   if response.status_code == 200:
       data = response.json()
       print(f"Successfully collected {len(data)} records")
   else:
       print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
   ```

3. **Form Submissions**
   - Online surveys
   - Web forms
   - Mobile app data collection

### 2.2 Unstructured Data Collection

Unstructured data doesn't fit neatly into predefined formats:

1. **Web Scraping**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for web scraping
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   
   url = "https://example.com/products"
   response = requests.get(url)
   soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
   
   # Extract product names
   product_names = soup.find_all('h2', class_='product-name')
   for product in product_names:
       print(product.text.strip())
   ```

2. **Text Mining**
   - Document analysis
   - Social media content
   - Customer reviews

3. **Image and Video Data**
   - Computer vision techniques
   - Metadata extraction

> **Hands-on Exercise:** Write a Python script to collect data from a public API of your choice. Document the steps you took and any challenges you encountered.

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

### 3.1 Handling Missing Values

Missing data can significantly impact your analysis. Here are strategies for addressing it:

1. **Identification**
   ```python
   # Example Python code to identify missing values
   import pandas as pd
   
   df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
   
   # Check for missing values
   print(df.isnull().sum())
   
   # Visualize missing values
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False, yticklabels=False)
   plt.title('Missing Value Heatmap')
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Treatment Methods**
   - **Deletion:** Remove rows or columns with missing values
   - **Imputation:** Replace missing values with substitutes
     - Mean, median, or mode imputation
     - Regression imputation
     - K-nearest neighbors imputation
   - **Prediction:** Use machine learning to predict missing values
   - **Advanced techniques:** Multiple imputation, maximum likelihood estimation

### 3.2 Handling Outliers

Outliers can distort your analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions:

1. **Detection Methods**
   - Z-score method
   - IQR (Interquartile Range) method
   - Visual methods (box plots, scatter plots)

   ```python
   # Example Python code for outlier detection using Z-score
   import numpy as np
   
   def detect_outliers_zscore(data, threshold=3):
       mean = np.mean(data)
       std = np.std(data)
       z_scores = [(y - mean) / std for y in data]
       return np.where(np.abs(z_scores) > threshold)
   
   # Example usage
   outliers = detect_outliers_zscore(df['column_name'])
   print(f"Outliers found at indices: {outliers}")
   ```

2. **Treatment Strategies**
   - Remove outliers
   - Transform data (log transformation, etc.)
   - Cap outliers (winsorization)
   - Separate analysis for outliers

### 3.3 Data Standardization and Normalization

Standardizing your data ensures consistent scales across variables:

1. **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for normalization
   from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
   
   scaler = MinMaxScaler()
   df_normalized = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
   ```

2. **Standardization (Z-score Scaling)**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for standardization
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   df_standardized = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
   ```

> **Hands-on Exercise:** Clean a provided dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing numerical features. Document your approach and reasoning for each step.

## 4. Data Transformation

### 4.1 Feature Engineering

Creating new features can uncover hidden patterns:

1. **Mathematical Transformations**
   - Logarithmic transformation
   - Polynomial features
   - Binning numerical data

2. **Categorical Encoding**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for one-hot encoding
   import pandas as pd
   
   # One-hot encoding
   df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['categorical_column'])
   
   # Label encoding
   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
   
   encoder = LabelEncoder()
   df['encoded_column'] = encoder.fit_transform(df['categorical_column'])
   ```

3. **Date and Time Features**
   - Extracting day, month, year
   - Creating cyclical features for time data
   - Calculating time-based differences

### 4.2 Data Aggregation

Summarizing data at different levels:

1. **Grouping and Summarizing**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for data aggregation
   # Calculate average sales by product category and region
   sales_summary = df.groupby(['product_category', 'region']).agg({
       'sales_amount': ['mean', 'sum', 'count'],
       'profit_margin': 'mean'
   }).reset_index()
   ```

2. **Pivot Tables**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for creating a pivot table
   pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(
       df,
       values='sales_amount',
       index='product_category',
       columns='region',
       aggfunc='sum',
       fill_value=0
   )
   ```

> **Hands-on Exercise:** Perform feature engineering on a dataset to create at least three new features that might improve analytical insights. Explain the rationale behind each new feature.

## 5. Data Integration

### 5.1 Combining Data from Multiple Sources

1. **Database Joins**
   ```sql
   -- Example SQL join
   SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.order_date, o.amount
   FROM customers c
   JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01';
   ```

2. **Pandas Merge Operations**
   ```python
   # Example Python code for merging dataframes
   # Inner join
   merged_df = pd.merge(
       customers_df,
       orders_df,
       on='customer_id',
       how='inner'
   )
   
   # Left join
   merged_df = pd.merge(
       customers_df,
       orders_df,
       on='customer_id',
       how='left'
   )
   ```

### 5.2 Data Consistency Challenges

When integrating data, watch for:

1. **Schema inconsistencies**
   - Different column names for the same data
   - Different data types

2. **Value inconsistencies**
   - Different units of measurement
   - Different categorization systems
   - Different date formats

3. **Entity resolution**
   - Identifying when records from different sources refer to the same entity
   - Handling duplicates
