# Chapter 1: Introduction to React

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook (now Meta) and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Why React?

- **Declarative:** React makes it easy to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite
3. Understand the project structure
4. Learn about essential development tools

## Your First React Component

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
```

## Key Concepts

- JSX
- Virtual DOM
- One-way Data Flow
- Component Lifecycle
