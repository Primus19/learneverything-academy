## 1. Understanding Big Data

### 1.1 What is Big Data?

Big data refers to datasets that are too large or complex for traditional data processing applications. The concept encompasses not just the volume of data, but also its variety, velocity, and other characteristics that make it challenging to work with using conventional methods.

#### The 5 Vs of Big Data

1. **Volume**: The sheer amount of data generated and collected
   - Global data creation is projected to grow to more than 180 zettabytes by 2025
   - A single autonomous vehicle can generate up to 4TB of data per day
   - Modern enterprises manage petabytes of data across their operations

2. **Velocity**: The speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed
   - Social media platforms process millions of posts per second
   - IoT sensors continuously stream data in real-time
   - Financial markets generate thousands of transactions per second

3. **Variety**: The different types and formats of data
   - Structured data: Relational databases, spreadsheets
   - Semi-structured data: JSON, XML, email
   - Unstructured data: Text documents, images, audio, video

4. **Veracity**: The trustworthiness and quality of the data
   - Data accuracy and completeness
   - Reliability of data sources
   - Consistency across different systems

5. **Value**: The ability to turn data into meaningful insights
   - Business intelligence and decision support
   - Predictive analytics and forecasting
   - Process optimization and automation

> **Knowledge Check:** For each of the following scenarios, identify which of the 5 Vs presents the biggest challenge:
> - A healthcare system processing millions of patient records with inconsistent formatting
> - A financial institution detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time
> - A social media platform storing and analyzing billions of images and videos
> - A manufacturing company collecting sensor data with occasional faulty readings

### 1.2 The Evolution of Data Processing

);

-- Load data from Cloud Storage
LOAD DATA INTO dataset.sales
FROM FILES (
    format = 'CSV',
    uris = ['gs://bucket/sales_data/*.csv']
);

-- Run an analytical query
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) as month,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM dataset.sales
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) = 2023
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

**Data Lakes**

CREATE TABLE sales_orc (
    id STRING,
    date STRING,
    customer_id STRING,
    amount DOUBLE
)
STORED AS ORC
TBLPROPERTIES ("orc.compress"="SNAPPY");

-- Insert data from another table
INSERT INTO TABLE sales_orc
SELECT * FROM sales_csv;

-- Query with predicate pushdown
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) as total
FROM sales_orc
WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 10000;
```

> **Knowledge Check:** For each of the following scenarios, which storage format would you recommend and why?
> - Streaming IoT sensor data that needs to be written quickly and read occasionally
> - Data warehouse with analytical queries that frequently filter and aggregate specific columns
> - Data that requires frequent schema changes as business requirements evolve
> - Log data that needs to be compressed efficiently for long-term storage
